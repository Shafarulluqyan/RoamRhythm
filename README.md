## Getting Started

Welcome to your travel website project! Follow these steps to set up and start working on your project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the initial result. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

4. **Editing the Pages:**
   Start editing your pages by modifying the files inside the `app` directory, especially `page.tsx`. Any changes you make will automatically update the page in real-time.

5. **Font Optimization:**
   This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and load the Inter font. You can customize the font according to your project requirements.
